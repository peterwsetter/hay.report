Hay.Report aims to provide insightful analysis of the hay market for producers, buyers, and farmers interested in moving to forages. Launching in January 2019, Hay.Report will begin by exploring possible benchmarks for tracking the market and aggregating commentary from [USDA AMS](https://www.ams.usda.gov/market-news/hay-reports) Market Reporters. 

In this initial launch, the focus will be on the Plains States of Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. As the project grows, other states may be added.

After the launch period, Hay.Report will begin a series of interviews with researchers and innovative farmers and ranchers, introducing new approaches and forages to a broader audience. We seek to support practices that profitable, conserve natural resources, and are resilient against drought and extreme weather.
